cease beating.  I was silent for some time and then I whispered  
goodbye and left without turning back."
disgust,"When I was a teacher in an evening school, a girl raised a lot of  
questions and expressed her opinions.  She, very often, took a  
stand which was different from mine and she thought that it  
was better than mine.  Her opinions were helpful academically, but   
she did not take into consideration my position in public.  Also  
she seemed to be very talkative and so she disgusted me."
shame,"I had lunch in a restaurant with a friend and I paid the bill.

people sitting next to me talked to each other for 20 minutes.

not told me the facts earlier, he need not have lied to me."
sadness,"When my mother went through an operation, it was not very serious  
but I was sad and could not sleep before the operation."
disgust,"During a recent meeting, Mr. A showed his excitement and

anxious about the project while my partners showed no concern   
and when we had meetings on the project my classmates  did not  
pay any attention.  Some of them read books while the others  
argued on irrelevant questions.  The meeting would go on for two  
hours without the main theme being discussed.  We wasted time and  
could not reach a compromise.  My classmates avoided doing the  
work and the responsibilities, they seemed to value other  
projects more than this one."

had developed quite well and it was a pity as our friendship would

opportunity to apologize."

friends of mine decided to believe in God.  The joy that I felt  
at that time was more than words can express.  I blessed them and  
praised God in my heart."
fear,"My friend and I had offended our classmate unintenionally.  We

developing this relationship and it was unsuccessful, I felt very  
sad."

grade.  I found that his humility was hypocritical and I found it  
disgusting."
shame,"Once in primary five, I had forgotten to take a book to class and  
the teacher punished me by asking me to stand at the back of the  
class.  I thought about the way my mother would react if she saw  
me being punished.  My mother was very good to me and though she  
did not see me punished, I felt sorry for her."
guilt,"I had fixed a meeting with my classmates and I missed it as I was  
tired.  Besides everyone at the meeting was a stranger to me and  
I did not want to make friends with them.  Whatever the reasons - I   
felt guilty."

Chinese university of H.K.  It was 7 o'clock in the morning.   
Later I told my family and relatives about it and had tea with  
them very joyfully."
fear,"I was camping in an old broken hut which had no lights.  I had  
brought along a lamp which was not working very well.  The door  
made strange sounds and I was sure that strange things were  
happening.  The most terrifying bit was that there were many  
wardrobes in the hut and everytime that I looked in the glass of  
the wardrobe I felt that there were ""objects"" behind me.   The  
whole night was spent in fear and restlessness."

had a drink, then I read my favourite book on the bed.  Suddenly  
I felt peace and joy."
fear,"When I went home and there was nobody, I waited till 2 A.M and       
still nobody.  I was suddenly scared and anxious as this had never  
happened before.  In addition my mother was very weak and I  
feared that she had met with an accident.  Therefore I was anxious   
all night."
anger,"Yesterday I read in the newspaper that a 30 year old woman had  
abused her 2 month old son and had caused his death.  I was very  
angry after reading this as this is not a human act and to abuse  
so fragile a life is not a forgivable sin."
sadness,"I had a schoolmate who went to the hospital as her brain was  
bleeding.  She fell unconscious for three days and when I went  
to see her I saw the miserable state the family was in.  Moreover  
I could not do nothing for her.  I was very sad.  Finally, she  
died."

to make me talk to him and disturbed me."

standing beside me.  I was very tired and sleepy and did not

beside me got up and gave her seat to the old woman and said,   
"" Old woman, please take my seat, the youngstters these days are  
not used to giving their seats to others.""  When I heard these  
words I was very ashamed of myself and wanted to get off the bus  
at once.  "
guilt,"After an exam I was in a very bad mood as I had done it very        
badly.  At home, my mother took so long to ask me how things had   
gone that I lost my temper.  I overreacted and made my mother cry.  
She still prepared lunch for me and did not scold me .  Suddenly,  
I thought that it was my fault and I started crying.

joy,"I was appreciated by others, especially my family members and my  
friends."
fear,"Whenever I am alone in a dark room, walk alone on the street,  
sleep alone in the room at night or see something which is only  
partly visible.  This emotion was very strong when as an 8 year    
old child I saw something horrible.  "
anger,"[ Whenever I put myself in other's shoes and try to make the  
person happy, comfort him or make friends and I am misunderstood  
and rejected, especially when this person is a family member or a friend.]"
sadness,"There was a conflict of interest between me and a close friend of  
mine.  He only thought about his own interest and not about our  
friendship.  This behaviour hurt his friends.  Another incident  
is when a friend isolated himself without giving any reasons."
disgust,When I saw a lot of rubbish and animal waste on the floor.
shame,"When I was emotionally unstable I said things which may have hurt  
others or made them feel unhappy.  When I calmed down I realized

feelings of others.  Then I felt ashamed as someone pointed out my  
behaviour to me."

late and I feared being scolded by my parents."
anger,"When I learnt that a friend of mine had talked about me to  
another friend and had said wrong things about my abilities and  
attitudes.  I was very angry."
sadness,"About two years ago my girlfriend suggested that we separate.   
This really gave me a shock as I had never thought that she would  
say such things.  The reason she gave me was that we were not  
suited for each other."
disgust,"Once while studying for my exam I found so many complicated words  
that it disgusted me."

us as to who had heard the fairy tale - I was the only one who  
put up his hand and this surprised the whole class."
guilt,"We always made a lot of noise during a certain lecture.  This may  
have been because we did not respect the lecturer. Finaly, the  
lecturer could not tolerate it and he scolded us angrily and  
pointed out our misbehaviour."
joy,"I felt happy when I received the letter telling me that I had  
been admitted to the university."
fear,"During the first year in university I had bad results in both  
the terms, especially the first term.  I was afraid that  I would  
not be promoted to the next year and that the others would go  
ahead of me."
anger,Once my father slapped my mother for a small quarrel.
sadness,"A few years ago my mother suffered from canccer and died within  
two years.  We had not finished our studies then and could not  
bear our responsibilities as her children.  My mother had tried  
her best to take care of us but she lived in pain these two  
years.  Neither the doctor nor we could do anything for her as  
cancer is incurable.  I was very eager to replace her in  
suffernig , even die instead of her."
disgust,"I used to play with a group of classmates and I found out later  
that they were cheap in thought, behaviour and conduct - they  
would smoke, fight and speak foul language.  I thought that they  
destroyed the image of college students."

G.P.A was very low."
guilt,"Many years back I quarrelled with my younger brother for a small

recovered after a treatment which lasted several months.  After  
this our relationship was worse and he would not listen to me."
joy,"One Saturday afternoon, I deliberately dressed up nicely (I had  
been in a bad mood of late).  I hoped to go for a walk in the  
soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits.  When I was having  
lunch in the canteen, two of my male classmates asked me as to  
why I was dressed so nicely (they had seldom joked with me  
before).  One of them said that he had a lounge suit and we would  
look very nice if we wore them together."
fear,"The exam was drawing near and I wanted to prepare for it.  But I  
had a lot of other things to do so I did not have much time to prepare   
for the exams.  Whenever I sat down to study I was scared that I would   
not be able to finish it."
anger,"A female classmate was always late for meetings which were for  
the homework and not social gatherings.  We were very busy and  
the deadline was close but we had to waste half an hour or an  
hour waiting for her as we could do nothing else then."
sadness,"After a meeting ended we started talking about when we would  
have the next discussion ( I had many tests the coming week and  
could not have a meeting in between, I thought that they would  
understand this as they had always done).  They did not  
understand my problem and thought that I should not have so many  
other activities.  Their reaction made me burst into tears."

next to me talking in an intense and soft voice.  They were  
disturbing others."
shame,"During an informal discussion I contributed a lot even though I  
had not spent much time studying.  Whenever someone said that  
someone was not paying attention, or that he had too many other  
things to do, or that the persoon was not trying his best, I  
would feel ashamed."
guilt,"Our class had organized a picnic in November.  I was the class  
representative so I became the organizor.  However the picnic  
was postponed by one week and I had something else to do then.  
Initially I did not ponder on what to do and decided to go for  
the picnic.  When I had the time to think about it I thought that  
my decision was wrong.  My classmates thought that I would go as  
I had signed my name but I did not go.  I told another class  
representative that I was not going but he did not know the  
reason behind my not going.  After the picnic my classmates asked  
me why I had not gone to the picnic and everytime someone  
mentioned it I was apologetic.  I should have decided right in  
the begining that I would not go and then they would not see me  
as irresponsible i.e promising to go and changing my mind  
afterwards."
joy,"It was the first time I met him (my boyfriend Mr.W).  It was  
during the first term Summer vacations.  We met each other while  
handing in our homework.  He invited me have a trip with him and  
we were together till 8 P.M."
fear,"The day the results of the certificate exam came out.  I went to  
school and at first I did not feel frightened.  By the time I  
reached the fourth floor ( the results were being given on the  
fifth floor) I found it difficult to walk and felt that I would  
die."
anger,"One day I had sunned my favourite shirt and was putting it back  
in the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and  
wore it.  He had not had a bath and was very dirty.  I scolded him  
but he answered back and locked himself up in a room.  I was very  
angry so I starteed kicking on the door and abusing him loudly  
and freely."
sadness,"When I was a child I was playing on the upper deck of the bed  
with my brother.  My parents slept on the lower deck.  My father  
felt disgusted and beat me up.  I felt very sad as my father had  
never beaten me or scolded me before."
disgust,"My boyfriend and I did not have any contact with each other during   
the Summer holidays.  I met him the day of the registration and looked   
through him.  In the canteen he asked me if I wanted to have a drink and   
I said no as I did not want him to do me a favour."
shame,"On Christmas eve I went to a classmate's home with other  
classmates.  The next morning when I came out of the toilet she  
said something and I did not understand what she was saying.   
When she pointed at my trousers I discovered that I had forgotten  
to zip them up.  I rushed back to the toilet but by the time the  
others had guessed what had happened."
guilt,"One night,when I was in primary 5 or 6, I felt thirsty so I

waited for dawn."

graduation I prepared to celebrate her birthday and I called off  
all my appointments.  I got together the other friends and we

disappeared on her birthday.  When I phoned another friend I  
didcovered thay she was busy, I did not call her anymore."

seems that I am deceiving myself but I cannot find the way out."

candidature number."

I tried my best."
anger,"I had a date with my girlfriend, the time and place had not been  
fixed.  I asked her to phone me an hour later as it was midnight

joy,"During my Summer vacations I planned a carnival for the community  
youth center with a few other volunteers.  I was the head of the  
organizors and we spent over a month planning it.  During this  
period we got to know and understood each other.  We  
discovered each others potential and we planned many interesting  
things for the carnival.  The day of the carnival everything was  
bright, the programmes went well and the attendants enjoyed it.   
I felt extremely excited about it."
anger,"I was a prefect at secondary school.  On the sports day I told  
others that I would take down the names of the people who  
misbehaved and after some time I sat down for a brief rest.   
Suddenly the head prefect came and scolded me in front of others.  
 I was very angry as there were other prefects sitting and he  
picked on me.  I thought that a brief rest was not  serious  
enough to be blamed."
disgust,"I had joined a youth group that observed the affairs of our  
community and so I had many opportunities to contact the  
government and the committee members of the district board (a  
local executive structure).  We always tried to consult and  
discuss with them, but we found that such people did not  
understand community affairs and they even dampened our  
enthusiasm in local affairs.  I did not understand why they had  
decided to work as community leaders."
shame,"One day I was the leader of the weekly meeting of the Church  
fellowship.  That day I had been preparing for the exams and did  
not estimate the time to travel to the church right and I was  
twenty minutes late.  As I had not prepared well I led the  
meeting badly.  I was ashamed of myself.  "
guilt,"I borrowed my classmate's notebook one week before the  
examination and I promised to give it back to her in two days  
time.  I was very busy at that time and forgot many things; as I  
was not very often at home she could not contact me.  When I  
started my revision I realized that her notebook had been on my  
desk for five days.  I contacted her immediately and gave it back  
to her.  Though she did not say anything I felt very guilty."

It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I  
lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to  
spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always  
remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I  
suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil  
servant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a  
criminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with  
them."

public examination."

we (6 of us) waited for the members of the band to greet us in  
front of the stage.  We went out after a few minutes as it was  
time to close the hall.  We had been waiting at the entrance hall  
for ten minutes when three of the band members came out.  They  
were very excited to see us, one of them was so excited that he  
had tears in his eyes.  We felt very warm and close to each  
other.  They took us back into the hall and we talked freely.  We  
were together for about an hour and during this time we felt  
that they were very sincere."
fear,"At noon one Sunday I received a phone call telling me that my  
mother had been knocked down by a car at the street crossing and

should have been very happy; however my grandmother, because of

should have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new  
house that day."

When I arrived I saw that some people , who were not close  
friends of the departing person(person A), were playing mahjong.   
Some others were playing bridge and A had nothing to do, besides  
it was A who had prepared the food.  Later when we wanted to talk  
and his classmates did not even have the decency to listen to him.   
They only asked him a few questions half-heartedly and then they  
talked on their own.  Some of their conversation was against me and   
another classmate."
shame,"When I was in lower six I joined an interview group to  
interview the general public.  One of my friends in the group  
lost her purse and she was very nervous.  Five of us had to go  
another place so we left her, and planned to see her later.  Then  
I heard her describing how her purse looked.  I realized that I  
had seen her purse on the floor and had not wanted to do any  
thing about it. "
guilt,"I went to a friend's baptism as she became a Christian after me  
and I realized that she was more enthusiastic about her spiritual  
life than I was.  When I was with my brothers and sisters of  
Christ I had a guilty feeling which could not be dismissed  
easily.  When pepole asked me as to when I would be baptised my  
guilt feeling deepened."

Before getting into the bus I had prepared the exact amount of  
coins to pay for the bus fair and when I got into the bus I put  
these coins into the box meant to collect the bus fair.  I  
thought that I had paid and wanted to get inside.  However the  
bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins  
were stuck at the opening  of the box.  He had not seen me paying  
and there wasn't a stack of coins in the box.  I could not  
understand this and the driver kept questioning me.  He made me  
feel angry and at last i inserted a dollar coin in the box just  
to get away from him.  Later I found that I had forgotten a few  
coins in my pocket and had not paid enough for the fair the first  
time.  After I had entered the bus I could still hear him  
scolding me and I felt disgusted."
shame,"A few days back I had a tutorial class and the teacher randomly  
assigned one person in each group to make a presentation.  The  
discussion in our group had been confused and the presentation  
was not very well prepared.  Unfortunately I was selected to

very poor.  I really felt ashamed."

messed up her belongings."
joy,"I had a dream : I had a very close friend who had several stone  
houses in the New Territories (villages) but they did not have  
much furniture.  He took me to see his fields (I had never seen  
them before) and there were several inches of clear water on  
which the sunshine was reflected.  I wanted to sit among the  
short green plants in the fields but was afraid of treading the  
plants to death.  My friend said ""They will not die"" and I sat  
down happily and my trousers did not get wet."
fear,"After seeing a horror film - Omen.  I could not sleep at night   
even though I closed my eyes.  The last scene of the film kept  
coming back to me, I seemed to hear the girls in the film  
shouting at the devil.  The devil did not have any expression on  
his face and I thought that he would choose me."
anger,"My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that  
he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's  
house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I  
felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so  
he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is  
I was in a bad mood then)."
sadness,"I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good  
friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them  
I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind  
this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made  
up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was  
sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends."
disgust,"I had a friend who was very kind to me.  I tried my best to like  
him and understand him but when I was with him I could not help  
rejecting, criticizing and blaming him.  I wanted to get away  
from him as soon as possible."

when we talked of the Summer job, I felt ashamed."

succeeded.  However a year later I got the bad habit again.  I felt   
useless as I always found excuses to explain my behaviour.  As a result I  
felt guilty."
joy,"During the exam period I studied in the library alone.  A close    
friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my  
application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had  
been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the  
list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was  
really included in the list.  I was so excited that I smiled all  
day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the  
good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my  
studies.  
"
fear,"A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes  
outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would  
question me on our relationship.  I treated him as a friend and  
did not want any misunderstandings.  Therefore I refused to meet  
him and told him that I would see him the coming day.  I was very  
unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble."
anger,"We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the  
inter-department song contest.  I arrived and found that there  
was nobody there.  When I went to the canteen I found them eating  
lunch.  I was so angry that I aired my greviances to one of them  
and then left."
sadness,"A friend told me that he had suffered in love and in academics.   
I shared his sadness."
disgust,"A friend told me that a boy wanted to get to know me.  At that  
time I felt disgusted and thought that it was a nonsense thing."
shame,"One rainy day when the streets were wet, and as I was walking down  
a slope, I fell down out of my carelessness.  There were many  
people and they saw me, so I felt ashamesd.  Moreover I hurt my  
ankle and it was painful."
guilt,"One night during dinner my nephew was naughty, so I quarrelled with my   
parents.   I regreted this as my nephew was only two years old and I   
had to tolerate him !  The quarrel made my father think that his children   
may not take care of him in the future (it was a slip of the tongue and   
this made me realize that my father keeps his thoughts to himself).  I was   
still very angry so I dropped my bowl and chopsticks and went to the kitchen   
to drink tea and then ran to the other side of the house."
joy,"That afternoon I rushed home to look at the result slip of the  
higher level as fast as possible.  I opened the envelope very  
carefully and found that my results were much better than I  
had expected and thus I could enter the Chinese university.  My  
diligence had paid and I was very happy."
fear,"When I was young I had gone to an old lift and played with the  
antique lift.  The guy discovered me and warned me, I was very  
frightened."
anger,"Whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very  
uncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him  
furiously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence  
because of traditional moral values.  "
sadness,"My got my mathematics test's marks and could not believe that it  
was true.  In the past I would have at least 80% marks.  Was I  
getting weaker at studies ?  This made me feel that I should not  
expect too much from going to the university."
disgust,"My friend and I worked for the community centre by holding a booth.  
 One day my friend went off to another booth to play.  This  
meant that I was very busy and could not maintain order.  His  
behaviour disgusted me."
shame,"When I was in a bus on my way to the examination centre, a man     
sitting opposite me kept looking at me continously.  I did not know   
what was wrong.  When I reached the  centre I started strolling around   
as I still had a little time.  Suddenly a man came and whispered ""You   
have forgotten to zip up your trousers.""  I was at a loss to say anything   
and I felt very embarrassed.  When I thought of the bus incident I felt   
even more ashamed."
guilt,"At secondary school, one of my classmates lost her locker key.   
During a class I saw two other classmates holding a key and  
talking secretly.  I do not know why I suspected them, also  
another classmate supported me.  He remembers that these people  
had only one key in the key-ring, this had seemed strange to him.  
 Besides another classmate said that he had seen them selling  
books at a book-shop and they should not have had such books.  I  
told the teacher and the person was caught.  He had sold the  
books and was forced to quit school.  I found that I had not  
helped him as he stole later on also.  I felt guilty"
joy,"One night, my boyfriend expressed his love for me in the canteen in  
the presence of my friends by giving me a present."

quiet road and I was scared of meeting a ghost."

several friends as she was a friend's friend.  However my friend  
had never introduced me to her and when she got off the bus I  
smiled at her but she did not respond pretending not to have seen  
me.  Her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry."
sadness,"My examination results were not satisfactory even though I had  
tried my best.  Then I started wondering about my abilities for  
the major subject.  However I did not know how to choose my major  
subject if I were to change it."
disgust,"When my roommate and I had dinner together we decided as to who  
would clean the bowls.  One day when I came back from school I  
found that she had not cleaned up.  Since I had to cook dinner I  
cleaned them myself and felt unhappy and disgusted."
shame,"When I asked my classmate to teach me to do my homework, he asked  
me to study by myself first but I did not do it.  When he asked me  
 if I had studied, I felt very ashamed. "
guilt,"I escaped from communicating with God for a long time.  I did not  
read the scriptures and I did not pray.  I felt that I was  
getting further and further away from God.  I felt guilty as this  
was because of my laziness."
joy,"When two female classmates and I were having lunch, we chatted and   
cracked jokes, I was very happy.  However, I felt that I may have   
said something inappropriate which might cause them to have a bad   
impression of me."
fear,"I did not do well in one of the subjects last term.   I was  
afraid that I would fail.  My result was a grade D, though it was  
not good I still passed.  I felt more comfortable then.  "
anger,"My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt  
insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did  
not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other  
friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant  
person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that  
nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not  
say anything but just watched me leave."
sadness,"Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before  
the result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I  
got a D and as the results of the other subjects were not all       
good I felt a little sad."
disgust,"Whenever I spoke to a female classmate I felt disgusted.  She  
said meaningless things and seemed to indicate something to me  
but I did not love/like her."
shame,"Once a female classmate told me that the clothes I wore seemed to  
be a child's clothes.  On hearing this I felt a little ashamed and  
I criticized her clothes though there was nothing wrong with  
them."
guilt,"Once while playing tennis with my classmate I lost a few tennis  
balls.  I found one near the tennis court and took it to be mine

opened my book to read.  In my heart I wanted to give them the  
seat."
joy,"It was the first time that I gave a birthday present to my friend.  
  She wrote me a letter as she is my girlfriend.  The content of  
the letter was so sweet that it made me feel very happy. 
"
fear,"It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I  
had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that  
I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld  
have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period  
- I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice  
experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable  
fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright  
prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my  
brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue  
I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased."
anger,"The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often  
grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This  
made me angry."
sadness,"When I was in primary 6, my father died.  I was very young then  
and did not know what had happened.  The weeping of my relatives  
and my tears made me sad."
guit,"At hostel, my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid  
doing anyhting that did not concern him.  A few of us prepared lunch  
together and had decided to share the work.  My roomate had  
promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime  
after dinner.  I tried to wait and thought that he would realize  
his fault.  I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a  
university student and ought to have self-respect.  He  
disappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him  
and did not want to keep any contact with him."
shame,"My friend had many female friends and I thought that they were  
his lovers.  I would scold him but he did not accept my advice.   
Later I learnt from his girlfriends that this was not true.  I  
felt ashamed at having misunderstood him."
guilt,"In the past I used to think that my mother was a very nagging  
person.  When I started living at the hostel we had little time  
to meet each other.  Whenever I went home she would take care  
of me.  I gradually realized that what she had done was for my  
own good.  So very time I saw her I felt guilty."
joy,"In August,1983, the long awaited ""big envelope"" (a document for  
C.U.H.K admission) arrived.  It was in the afternoon and I had  
not been doing anything.  When the postman, with his big bag,  
knocked on the door I knew what it was about.  I hurriedly  
opened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe.  
 It lasted several hours and only calmed down later."
fear,"On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was  
afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very  
unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of  
passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to  
repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results  
were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a  
minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
anger,"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not  
like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation  
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt  
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost  
5 marks.""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower  
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not  
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."
fear,"This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September  
I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in  
the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not  
find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about  
sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.   
I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock."
anger,"My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had  
melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played  
the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell  
him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right  
to disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to  
leave the room and go somewhere else."
shame,"Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was  
working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had  
joined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female  
classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not  
fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.  I  
realized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide.  Later I  
said sorry to her and the matter came to an end."
shame,I lied to one of my best friends.
joy,I received a letter from a distant friend.
fear,"My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a  
male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I  
hung up and heard someone walking outside our door."
shame,"Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her  
grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in  
mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me  
and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.   
When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be  
employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university   
there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they  
made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five  
days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another  
child to teach."
shame,"I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had  
prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After  
three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and  
failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others  
would think that I had not prepared for it."
fear,"I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the  
door.  I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit  
and bring the germs in the house."
guilt,"I did not do the homework that the teacher had asked us to do.  I  
was scolded immediately."
fear,"I had shouted at my younger brother and he was always afraid when  
I called out loudly."
